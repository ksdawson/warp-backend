Main functions of the backend are to: (1) generate headcount plans given a user prompt and context (2) provide data on role/city comp. The former has a basic working implementation, but it could be improved by adding more context (e.g. links, files, etc). The latter is not yet implemented. The idea is to scrape data from sources like levels.fyi. If the data size is pretty small could just store is on S3 and have the frontend load the entire dataset. Alternatively, could use an actual database solution like DynamoDB.
